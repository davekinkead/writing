# Bootstrapping Democracy

PhD Confirmation Paper, February 2013

### Introduction 

Democratic theory stands upon shaky normative grounds, that like any building, threaten to topple a range of higher order concerns relating to political legitimacy, authority, and obligation.  Despite a revival of interest in the normative foundations of democracy from political theorists over the last 40 years, little progress has been made beyond Churchill's pragmatic quip that 'democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others we've tried from time to time'.  Perhaps because democracy _can't_ be justified.

The very nascent, and still amorphous thesis that I intended (perhaps) to defend in my dissertation is that democracy, according to extant accounts at least, cannot be coherently defended.  

Contemporary accounts of democracy can be roughly divided into those justified on external grounds and those justified from internal ones.  External, or foundationalist justifications, all rely on some pre-democratic notion or principle upon which their account is built such as freedom, equality or autonomy.  Internal, or anti-foundationalist justifications, on the other hand, claim that any attempt to justify democracy on something outside its practice is disingenuous because those alleged foundations can only be interpreted through the prism of existing practices [^rorty1996idealizations]. We must only, anti-foundationalists claim, compare actual non-ideal practices against other potentially realisable non-ideal practices.

Both types of accounts face obstacles.  The challenge for foundationalist accounts in general is two fold. Firstly, they must find some common ground upon which all parties can agree to.  For Hobbes, this was necessity; for Locke, liberty; and for Rawls, justice.  Secondly, they must show how their account is entailed from these agreed upon foundations.  If what we fear most is _bellum omnium contra omnes_, then subjugation to the Leviathan is the price we must all pay. If however, it is freedom we value above all else, then we must protect ourselves from the encroachment of the state; while if justice is the only thing reasonable and rational men unaware of their future positions would agree to, then we are committed to the wide redistribution of primary goods.

These two challenges are significant, and given the level of debate in political theory about these issues, largely unsettled.  But foundationalist accounts of democracy face additional challenges.  If democracy is the realisation or instrument of some pre-democratic notion, then why do we need to justify democracy in the first place? If democracy is simply the result of prior foundations, then why not focus our justificatory efforts on those instead?  Or if democracy has instrumental value in obtaining those foundational values, then justifications of democracy must also show that it is the only, or at least best, instrument to obtain them.

Anti-foundationalist accounts face their own set of challenges.  Some critiques of anti-foundationalism have charged it with irrationalism and emotivism [^talisse2004democracy:69], offering little more justification of democratic practices than what ever is, is; that if democratic theory is unable to rest on external foundations and must instead rely only upon pragmatic discourse as the method of reason, then the only justifiable democratic practice is whichever one exists once all the talking has stopped.  Clearly, this interpretation is uncharitable - anti-foundationalists don't claim that all justifications are disingenuous, only ones based on self evident, a priori, or axiomatic external truths.  Anti-foundationalism in this vain parallels Darwinistic accounts of evolution.  It is just as ludicrous to ask why freedom ought be valued over equality as it is to ask why primitive mammals were more morally deserving of survival than giant reptiles [^rorty1996idealizations:334].  Foundationalists, they claim, are simply asking the wrong question.

But still the problems linger.  If the normative principles of democracy can only be justified from within the actual practice itself, what form could these justifications take?  Rorty[^rorty1996idealizations:335] for example, suggests substituting external foundations with the idea that what makes us special is "our ability feel for, cherish, and trust people very different from ourselves", but this appears to be nothing more than a foundationalist claim about human nature.  Even if we limit our justifications to _more of this practice and less of that_, we must still justify _these_ claims somehow if we ever want to make normative comparisons - _why_ more of this practice is better than less of that one.  If we can't justify one form of democracy over another, then we can't justify some democracy over some non-democracy. Anti-foundationalism fails to allow this comparison.

My hope, or perhaps naive optimism, is that in the course of the next few years research I can identify a different justificatory account of democracy that avoids failing foul of these dilemmas.  My intuition is that democracy can be built upon foundations, but foundations that are internal to democracy itself. Much like recursive formula or mathematical induction, democratic theory will then be able to pick itself up by its own bootstraps. Call this non-foundationalism, or perhaps, _bootstrapping_. 

## Democracy is not Democratic

How does a people decide exactly who should be included amongst the people? The democratic method would be to vote on the matter but then who should vote? It can’t be _the people_ because who _the people_ are is only determined after the vote has been tallied.  How does a people decide the boundaries of the political and the demarcation of personal from collective decisions? Again, voting can’t be the solution because limiting the domain of the political via collective decision is itself a political action, while voting to increase the political makes vacuous the whole notion of the personal.  How does a people agree to an electoral system when the choice of electoral system itself requires agreement on an earlier electoral system in order for the choice to be democratic? 

These democratic dilemmas form part of what I call the Bootstrap Paradox - the inability of democratic systems to justify themselves democratically. In each case, a democratic solution seems impossible without either unanimous agreement or resort to non-democratic means, and neither of these solutions is attractive to a democrat.  Unanimous, collective agreement is both practically unlikely and indistinguishable from unanimous non-collective non-binding agreement, making the state no different from anarchy. Non-democratic justifications on the other hand, if substantive enough, threaten to undermine accounts of democratic legitimacy and tempt us to reject democracy in favour of these prior non-democratic ideals.

For the rest of this paper, I'm going to defend a paradoxical thesis that roughly maps my larger thesis outline, namely that democracy is not democratic. Its establishment, alteration and operation all require justificatory recourse to non-democratic ideals, and any substantively non-democratic system cannot be justified as being democratic.  Or perhaps it can be if we reject contemporary accounts of democracy in favour of something else entirely.  I'm not sure yet and I still have considerable work to do before I'm confident supporting these claims either way.

### The Bootstrap Paradox

My core argument can be stated as follows:

1. A system can only be justifiably labelled democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.
2. A substantive number of these systems & procedures cannot be called democratic by any coherent interpretations of the term.
3. Democracy therefore, cannot be justifiably labelled democratic.

Of course, this paradox only bites if the premises are true.  Like many paradoxes it is possible, likely even, that the Bootstrap Paradox is little more than invalid deduction camouflaged by semantic equivocation.  So considerable effort will need to be spent clarifying exactly what _democracy_ means according to various accounts of it.  Not only has democracy come to represent a range of _ideals_ such as freedom, equality and popular sovereignty, it has also been variously interpreted as a _system_ which legitimates authority, distributes power, aggregates preferences, and creates knowledge.  These interpretations of democracy determine and constrain the normative justifications of contemporary accounts of democracy.  This is the focus of Part One of my thesis.  

In Part Two, I will be examining a number of problems that lie at the foundations of democratic theory.  How can a people constitute themselves in a way that doesn't undermine the legitimacy of the state?  Are coherent democratic process for succession or unification even possible? How can a constitution be created and ratified democratically? How can the contested limits of liberalism be determined democratically without undermining liberalism itself?  These dilemma will show that no extant account of democracy is able to provide sufficient normative justifications for the meta-processes, such as demarkation, creation, and alteration, required for the operation of the state.  And if sufficiently many processes and procedures of a system of government are not democratic, then that system cannot justifiably be called democratic.

Part Three will, or at least I hope it will, provide some possible solutions the problems I have just raised.  Currently, my thoughts on this are too underdeveloped to present anything of note, other than my aim to use an inductive or recursive processes to bootstrap my account of democracy.  What follows are selected excerpts fthat (hopefully) my broader thesis will roughly map to, primarily focusing on elements of Parts One and Two.

## What Democracy?

### Ideals

_Democracy_ in modern parlance has become a vacuous term, a simple substitute for vague, positive feelings towards one form of government or another.  It has become synonymous with notions of equality and popular sovereignty, justice and rule of law, voting and majoritarianism, liberalism and freedom; yet many of these values conflict and some necessarily so.  But when a term means everything, it means nothing.  

Conceptions of democracy guide and constrain accounts of democratic legitimacy, and it is clear that contemporary views of it vary widely.  The recent debate on compulsory voting in Australia is illustrative.  Liberal Senator Nick Minchin has claimed that "compulsory voting is an infringement of the democratic rights of Australians" [^2] while Victorian Liberal MP Josh Frydenberg praises it as "a pillar of democracy"[^3].  When the one proposal can be simultaneously labelled both democratic and undemocratic, by members of the same party even, then it is obvious the term is too vague to be a useful tool of analysis. Some clarification is in order and I will attempt to make explicit exactly what notion of democracy I will be invoking.

Etymology suggests we start in Athens. Herodotus was supposedly the first to coin the term _demokratia_ (δημοκρατία) to denote rule of the people or more precisely, popular sovereignty [^isakhan2012so:22].  Popular sovereignty though, can be variously thought to mean rule _of_ the people, _for_ the people, and _by_ the people.  Rule _of_ the people suggests the demos as the source of sovereignty.  Typically, the consent from, contract with, or benefit of the people is the medium through which political authority to the state and obligation of the demos is legitimated.  Clearly this prevents hereditary monarchies and autocratic regimes from claiming the label _democracy_ but still encompases a number of non-democracies like popular totalitarians [^populartotalitarian][^sondrol1991totalitarian].

Rule _by_ the people implies a active role for the citizen in the decision making process.  Participation in the formulation of rules and norms which guide the coercive power to which a citizen is subjected to, are a key part of .... 
 a form of direct and participatory democracy, while rule _for_ the people suggests that their will and interest is to a large degree manifested into law.

These characteristics however, seem largely absent from contemporary democratic states, and even to Athens itself.  Democracy today has become synonymous with representational democracy and few states integrate significant levels of referenda and plebiscite into the political process [^landsgemeinde].  There is little active role for the citizen outside of elections and popular participatory mechanisms such as forums rarely if ever wield formal power.  Special interest groups and lobbyists exercise overwhelming influence on the political agenda through what Lawrence Lessig calls dependence corruption [^lessig2011republic], a process whereby public debate is restricted to only those issues successfully contested amongst large donors.

Yet even in Athens, rule was only ever _of_, _for_ and _by_ a minority of the people. Citizenship extended to less than a quarter of inhabitants whilst suffrage was restricted to adult male citizens who represented only a tenth of the total population including metics and slaves [^hansen1991athenian].  For the vast majority of people in Athens, the coercive force of the state was something they had no influence over and which had little regard for their wellbeing.  If popular sovereignty is a constituent factor of democracy, then it has only ever been realised as an ideal, and a largely distant one at that.

How the people rule seems just as much an issue of democracy as who rules.  Voting is often thought to be the most democratic method of making collective decisions but it is neither a necessary, nor sufficient element of democracy.  In stark contrast with modern states, voting played a much smaller role in ancient democracies.  In Athens for example, most public appointments such as magistrates, jurors and archons were based sortition or lot, with voting limited to the Assembly and the appointment of generals [^hansen1991athenian].

Conversely, many non-democratic states employ voting in the political process, sometimes on a large scale.  In the former Soviet Union, elections were frequent, held every two years, the franchise was universal to all adult residents, election was by simple majority, and voting was conductive in private booths to ensure secrecy of the ballot [^jacobs1970soviet].  Of course, in the post Stalin years, candidates were limited to members of the Communist party and pre-approved by higher Soviets, rending elections to simple binary ratifications of the status quo by ticking the box or crossing out the name of the sole candidate on the ballot paper.  

Modern democratic states by contrast, are characterised by free and procedurally fair competitive elections with universal active franchise. Yet active franchise, the right to run for office, is often a right in name only.  In states whose electoral system is primarily based on plurality voting, the ability to run for office is severely constrained by economic means, leading to extensive dependency on party or donor support.  In Australia, only five of the 226 federal politicians are independents, and all these were previous party members [^aph] while in the US, George Washington remains the only independent President ever elected [^whitehouse], and the average wealth of a US Senator is estimated to be $14 million (median $2.5 million) [^USwealth].  This dependency on wealth or access severely limits the typical citizen's capacity to run for office and makes it far more comparable in actual, rather than prescribed terms, to elections in the Soviet Union.  

The contemporary conflation of voting and democracy becomes understandable once we consider access to power and equality.  The practical restriction of active franchise and absence of popular participation in contemporary psephocracies [^psesphocracies] makes voting instrumentally important in engendering some level equal political rights.  The notion of one vote, one value reflects another ideal - _isonomia_ or equality under the law that was central to ancient democracies [^manville1990origins].  Yet as John Burnheim [^burnheim2006democracy] shows, sortition is also compatible with equality, and noting the inequality of political access in modern states, it is likely that sortition provides a greater assurance of isonomia than competitive elections can.  As such, if voting does play any constitutive role in democracy, then it is purely instrumental, and a contingent one at that.

While seemingly necessary, it seems obvious that popular sovereignty, equality, and participation are insufficient to properly encompass contemporary notions of democracy.  Imaging for a moment, a world where the demos exercises full sovereignty over the state and all decisions made with equal and direct participation.  Every morning, the citizens debate and vote on what everyone will eat for breakfast, what they will wear and what they will do that day.  Today, we must all eat coco-pops and wear pink because that is what we've all decided, collectively and equally.  Yet few would accept this form of popular totalitarianism to be democratic because it lacks sufficient concern for individual liberty.

Liberalism has been the traditional response to the encroachment of collective or arbitrary power over the individual.  Liberalism has a rich history, encompasses a diverse range of ideas and has spawned a number of variants. Classical accounts portray liberalism as a kind of optimal set of collective constraints necessary for the maximisation of individual freedom for all, or what Oliver Wendell Holmes described as "the right to swing my fist ends where the other man's nose begins".  New, or social accounts of liberalism contrast this with a greater focus on the positive freedoms necessary to realise one's full potential, but all variants share a fundamental core value - the primacy of the individual and the presumption of freedom over its encroachment [^gauss1996justificatory].

There have been of course, a number of other ideals constitutive of democracy suggested by various political theorists.  Time restricts a continued analysis of this, as well as how democracy has been interpreted as a system for aggregating preferences, creating and refining knowledge, and limiting conflict.  These issues, and how they conflict with each other, will be explores in greater depth in Part One of my thesis.


### Justifications

Justifications and accounts of democracy are shaped by these interpretations.  A full review of contemporary, let along historical, democratic accounts is well beyond the scope of this paper but a few clarificatory notes are in order.  Democratic accounts can be conceptualised along a variety of dimensions.  I've already provided a brief summary of foundationalist & antifoundationalist but two other dimensions will be useful for my analysis: the instrumental / intrinsic and the procedural / substantive dichotomies.  The instrumental / intrinsic dichotomy concerns whether democracies are justified by the good outcomes that democratic processes bring about, relative to others, or whether their justifications are derived from qualities inherent to their methods.  It is concerned with _what_ legitimacy is derived from.  

Instrumental accounts can be found in the works of Condorcet [^list2002epistemic], Sen [^sen1999democracy] and Mill [^mill1861representitive].  Condorcet provides one of the earliest epistemic instrumental account in his Jury Theorem: that given a binary choice with a correct answer, and independent voters with a greater than even chance of being correct, the likelihood the majority is correct will approach certainty as the number of voters increases.  The actual number of voters required for this effect is remarkably small.  Even if the average voter has only a 51% chance of being correct, less than 1000 voters are needed for the likelihood of the majority being correct to reach 99% [^cjt99].

Mill and Sen on the other hand, offer consequential instrumentalist accounts.  Mill saw (representative) democracy as the best system to promote the good management of society because it was "attended with the greatest amount of beneficial consequences, immediate and prospective" for all citizens.  The structural requirements of democracy with wide franchise meant that the rights and interests of all were secured by the citizens ability to stand up for them.  Sen's claim that "no major famine has ever occurred in a functioning democracy" [^sen1999democracy:16], whilst more pragmatic, mirrors Mills consequential justifications.

Intrinsic accounts of democracy also claims that democracy produces good outcomes, but what distinguishes them from instrumental accounts is that in addition, they claim that democracy is desirable independent of those beneficial consequences.  Joshua Cohen for example, argues that democracy is a "fundamental political ideal" [^cohen1989deliberation:342] that is realised through deliberative collective decision making, and something that cannot be reduced to derivative values or outcomes.  Carol Gould [^gould2004globalizing] provides a considerably different intrinsic account of democracy based on self rule and determination, and argues that democracy is entailed by this which then gives us the right to be wrong in our decisions.

The procedural / substantive dichotomy by contrast concerns whether democratic outcomes are justified by their adherence to certain processes and procedures, or whether they promote certain values and ideals.  It is concerned with _how_ legitimacy is derived.  Typical of procedural accounts is Estlund's epistemic proceduralism in which the morally binding force of democratic deliberations is derived from the epistemic virtues of those procedures.  Procedures that tend to produce the best results have binding authority whereas those that produce poor results do not.  

Substantive accounts focus instead on how well processes bring about desirable values.  Rawls for example, argues that a system is just only if any inequalities it engenders benefit the least well off in society.  Procedural compliance here is only important in so far as it realises these foundational values.  These three dimensions - foundationalism, instrumentalism, and proceduralism - can overlap and intersect.  The accounts of Gould and Cohen are illustrative. Both are foundationalist (although Cohen's less so), both are non-instrumental accounts justified by democracies inherent value, but Cohen's is largely procedural whilst Gould's is substantive.

All six approaches face their own set challenges.  Foundationalist and intrinsic accounts must first explain why their foundational premises are self evident before showing why democracy is entailed from those premises. Anti-foundational accounts as argued in the introduction, fail to allow comparative analysis as their legitimation can only occurs after deliberation.  Instrumental accounts have the reverse of the foundationalist challenge - they must show democracy is the best means to realise certain ends, as well as why those ends should be valued.  Procedural accounts must ensure they don't clash with any substantive democratic values whilst substantive accounts still require procedures to realise their core values. 

### Directions

With these distinctions about the nature and justification of democracy in mind, we can now better address the first premise: 

>  P1 - A system can only be justifiably labelled democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.

One immediate concern here lexical priority.  Do democracies become democratic through their actions or are the actions of a democracy democratic analytically?  The later is certainly the easier solution as it make democracies democratic _ex vi termini_, but while simpler, this approach offers us little philosophical insight into the problem.  Our problem is identifying a method to evaluate the democratic nature of states - what we want is a way to justifiably say this state is democratic whist this one is not [^heuristic].

If then, democracies are states or systems that are democratic, we must also determine just how democratic does a system or state need to be in order for it to be justifiably labels a democracy.  Is there some threshold set of actions and values such as the rule of law, equal concern for all citizens, or free and fair elections that need to be met that qualifies a government as democratic, or is the notion some kind of spectrum from very democratic to not democratic?  

A related issue is that of potentiality and realisation.  Idealised or utopian accounts of democracy posit that democratic legitimacy is also derived from the fidelity of actual democracies to their ideals.  They require us to not only determine what a perfect democracy would be, but how close our current states approximate perfect ones.  Non-ideal theories on the other hand, argue that the democratic nature of a state can only be assessed according to what is likely to be achievable.

Here I side with Dahl who notes that these questions quickly lead us to a "tedious exploration of a semantic bog" [^dahl1971polyarchy:1].  So instead of argument, I will simply assert that _if_ a systemic is sufficiently democratic, then it can be justifiably called a democracy.  I take the notion of 'democratic' to be a scalar concept bounded by both ideals and reality, a relative notion that allows comparative claims of more or less democratic and which does not require some threshold to be crossed.  I hope this doesn't require too much charity.

## Problems and Paradoxes

A range of paradoxes and problems lie at the foundations of democratic theory, problems that collectively form part of what I call the Bootstrap Paradox.  A few of these where hinted at earlier: How can constitution be created legitimately when adherence to the constitution is the criterion of legitimacy?  How can a people legitimately determine who should be included or exclude as part of the 'the people' when the logically prior matter of _who_ is asked determines the outcome?  How can the people collectively determine the boundary of personal freedoms and public rules without making the notion of personal liberty vacuous?

In Part Two of my thesis, I intend to explore a range of these problems and how they undermine the legitimacy of democratic processes and systems.  For now however, I will just cover one of them, the initial problem that lead me down this path.  


### The Boundary Problem

The story of democracy begins with a people.  They come together, unite, proclaim, declare and form as one:

> "We the People  of the United States ... do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America" [^preambleUSconstitution]

> "Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania ... have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under ... the Constitution hereby established" [^preambleAUconstitution]

> "Le peuple français proclame à nouveau que tout être humain, sans distinction de race, de religion ni de croyance, possède des droits inaliénables et sacrés" [^preambleFRconstitution]

Democratic theory is built upon an assumption that a people, _the people_, exist and exist rightfully so.  Yet who the people _ought_ be, and therefore which group should rightfully govern themselves, is a totally neglected [^whelan1983prologue] and absolutely crucial problem for which there seems no theoretical solution to [^dahl1970after].  

This problem of inclusion and boundaries is separate from, although closely related to, the issue of suffrage and franchise.  Issues of franchise typically deal with who amongst those subjected to the coercive force of the law ought have some say in its formulation.  Whilst most modern liberal states no longer discriminate on the grounds of race or gender, resident aliens, children, and ex-felons are still formally excluded from the democratic process, and citizens with limited economic means are often informally excluded in a number of 'liberal' jurisdictions.  The Boundary Problem [^boundaryproblem] by contrast, relates to the issue of who should be subjected to the coercive force of the state in the first place - who should be a member of this jurisdiction rather than that.

The problem in the Boundary Problem arises once we recognise that who the people are is a matter logically and temporally prior to any subsequent democratic theory, and that extant accounts of democracy have been unable to solve this dilemma.  Normative democratic theory aims to provide us with an account of democratic legitimacy [^sep-authority]. It seeks to make evaluative and comparative claims concerning when and why democracy is desirable.  A central requirement of this endeavour is difference making.  Preference of one form of government over another, or of one form of democracy over another, requires that differing systems of government bring about different results, answers or states of affairs. In procedural accounts of democracy like Estlund's for example, the morally binding force of the results from a deliberative mechanism are derived from the epistemic virtues of that mechanism.  A legitimate process of law making needs to produce different, and superior, results to that of an illegitimate one for the account to be coherent.  Likewise for substantive accounts such as Rawls'.  A system that produces inequalities is legitimate only if those benefit the worst off members of society.  Without difference making, there can be no criteria upon which to make comparative evaluations.

But the Boundary Problem undermines democracy's ability to make these claims of legitimacy because that matter of who ought be included amongst the people makes subsequent processes arbitrary.  Consider for a moment, questions of inclusion and exclusions.  Say a sufficient number of people within a nation state have a strong desire for greater autonomy and self government like West Papua, the Basque region of Spain, or the states of the former Yugoslavia.  If we assume that all parties are committed to identical democratic procedures and values, then the outcome of any decision regarding independence of the succeeding state will depend wholly on who is included in the processes.  If only the population of the succeeding state is involved, then the answer will be very different to if only the people of the successor state are, and different again if both peoples are.  

This is not an problem that democratic theory can solve itself.  If we take legitimacy to be derived from fidelity to some democratic procedure, then it is immediately clear that a democratically legitimate solution results in an infinite regress.  If we are to vote, justify or deliberate on the issue of who should be included amongst the people, then we must first vote, justify or deliberate on the prior issue of who decides who decides who is included.  But to do this, we must first decide who decides on that, and so on.  If on the other hand, we take legitimacy to be derived from some substantive notion or ideal, then we are still faced with the problem.  As I will show shortly, extant substantive justifications fail to provide a a plausible solution.  Even if they did however, it is highly unlikely that any substantive value that underpins democracy would ever be universally accepted.  As such, some collective process or procedure is required to settle disputes over values, and these processes are subject to the same challenges that face procedural accounts.

The Boundary Problem extends far beyond issues of inclusion and exclusion however - it infects almost every collective action. Consider a proposal for redistribution for example.  Very different outcomes will occur if only the 'haves', the 'have nots', or both depending on the ratio of the two, are permitted a say in the matter, and this can occur even when both parties are committed to the same democratic processes and values.  Because the assumption of a fixed people is so ingrained in our dominant political paradigms, it is illustrative to consider a trans-national example.  It is clear that the First World's quality of life and living standards come partly at the expense of the Third World.  Agricultural subsidies in Europe and the US that depress prices and limit export revenue from Africa and Latin America [^farmsubsidies], and developed countries using energy and resources at rates far beyond what an equal global per capita share permits [^iea] are but two examples of this.  It can be reasonably argued on ground of justice and equality then, that the developed world ought compensate or redistribute some of its wealth to the developing world.  Yet even if all parties agree on a decision process and value justice and equality, the outcome will be different depending on who is included.  This is because there may still be disagreement about how to best realise those values, how much to redistribute, the method of redistribution, or even conflict with various other values the groups may hold such as responsibility or sovereignty.

Thus, we must resort to non or pre democratic justifications to solve the Boundary Problem.  This is not, in and of itself, problematic.  We saw earlier that the notion of democracy is one built upon a collection of related and conflicting pre-democratic ideals, so there is no prima facie objection to a solution based on non-democratic means that still preserves the legitimacy of subsequent democratic processes.  The dilemma for political theorist however, is that extant non democratic solutions are incapable of this.

Frederick Whelan [^whelan1983prologue] provides us with a comprehensive summary of possible solutions. Historical accident and the status quo is an unacceptable solution owing to its complete arbitrariness.  To make the legitimacy of contemporary democracy dependent on the contingencies of history seems ludicrous.  That Australia is a constitutional monarchy rather than a republic owes as much to that fact that in 1766 Louis-Antoine de Bougainville arrived at the Great Barrier Reef rather than Botany Bay, as it does to the 1999 referenda process.

Nationality as the basis of inclusion is also highly problematic.  The idea that state boundaries should roughly correspond with pre-existing national units has been dominant since the Treaty of Westphalia.  But only a cursory examination is necessary to dismiss nationality as unsuitable.  There appears to be no single objective criterion of nationality that is definite, and the non-voluntary nature of nationality stands in stark contrast to principles of democracy. Only the most homogenous contemporary states only comprise a single culture or language group [^homogenous] and cultural, linguistic or historical salience seem implausible grounds for determining non-linguistic or cultural issues.  

Furthermore, boundaries appear to determine nationality as much as nationality determine boundaries; one only need to speak of the Soviet, Yugoslavian, or even Italian or Australian people to recognise this.  Likewise, geographic or economic salience offer limit hope for a solution.  Rivers divide as often as provide a focal point for human settlement; mountains only seem like boarders to people from the plains; and satellite imagery of boarder towns and cities show just how strongly economic ties are determined by existing jurisdictions. 

Two other principles more aligned with democratic values have also been proposed as solutions: consent and affect.  Consent has a long been used as the basis for democratic legitimacy itself.  According to consent theorists, the only source of legitimate authority is the consent of those governed, and it is purely a matter of free choice for the people to unite together collectively. Locke for example, states: 

> "When any number of Men have so consented to make one Community or Government, they are thereby presently incorporated, and make one Body Politick, wherein the Majority have a Right to act and conclude the rest" [^locke1680second]

Similarly Rousseau:

> "There is but one law which, from its nature, needs unanimous consent.  This is the social compact; for civil association is the most voluntary of all acts ...  When the State is instituted, residence constitutes consent; to dwell within its territory is to submit to the Sovereign" [^rousseau1762social]

Yet consent theorists have very little to say about boundaries themselves.  The existence of broadly demarcated group of people is simply assumed and the original act of founding is typically an all or nothing affair.  While the initial act requires unanimity, there is no method to withdraw consent or alter the bounds of the _Body Politick_ once established.  Exactly how subsequent generations are bound without their consent by the actions of their grandparents remains today a thorn in the side of consent based accounts.  Consent does however offer a sufficient justification for the boundaries of _voluntary_ associations.  Inclusion and membership of a church, club, or football team is open and fluid, resting wholly on the the free choice of the individuals.  But as a justification of democracy, it fails precisely because states are non voluntary and claim exclusive territorial sovereignty over their subjects.

Yet the All Affected Principle quickly runs into problems.  In order for one thing to affect another, the former must in some way counterfactually change the latter.  To claim that a particular law affects my choices is to say nothing more than had the law not been, my choices would have been different.  This difference making requirement is axiomatic to the concept of affect with the status quo its relative benchmark.  

Just who is affected by some decision then, is contingent upon the outcome of that decision, but the outcome cannot be known until the decision has first been made.  Consider a proposal, say, to redistribute half the wealth of the wealthiest one percent of society to the poorest half.  If the proposal were to pass, then the wealthiest one and poorest fifty percent would be affected, and should therefore have a say in the matter.  But if the proposal were to fail, then no one would be affected, relative to the status quo, and hence no one should have a say (and thereby guarantee no one would be affected).  Clearly, inclusion based on actual affect has the notion of affect and inclusion backwards, and we must focus instead on including those potentially affected.

But potential affect is even more problematic.  The first challenge is degree of affect - exactly how affected must I be to be included?  In the previous example, the top one and bottom 50 percent are clearly affect although in different ways, but what of the middle 49%?  It is highly likely that there might be strong feeling from this group towards the redistribution, as well as material hardship and benefit caused by changes to the economy.  Mill's Harm Principle or Burnheim's [^burnheim2006democracy] Legitimate Material Interest offer some direction on where to draw the line but history is littered with the corpses of those prepared to die for abstract ideas such as religion, freedom and equality, making the line very difficult to draw at.

The second challenge to potential affect is agenda setting.  Accepting all those potentially affected by a decision, however limited by harm or interest that affect may be, merely assumes that the question is justifiably asked in the first instance.  But the question of who can set the agenda and propose questions to be decided leads to a Boundary Problem all of its own.  Liberalism and limits to the scope of public action is the typical response the question of what laws may be proposed but liberalism is neutral on issues of which people ought be included in which jurisdictions.  Even if we limit agenda setting to only issues congruent with liberalism, the scope of who is potentially materially affected seems to encompass all of humanity.

The third challenge of potential affect is that it would seem to require a vast array of overlapping jurisdictions.  If inclusion is determined by affect and affect is determined by issue, then we would need a different concept of _the people_ for every potential issue.  Ignoring the impracticalities of this for a moment, the clear problem here, like that of consent, is that it is incompatible with the notion of exclusive territorial sovereignty that is a fundamental feature of contemporary states.  

One way of approaching the All-Affected Principle that avoids this issue is to focus on those subjected to the coercion forces of the state.  Forfeiture, incarceration and even death, as well as their threats, certainly qualifies as a form of material affect.  Including all those subject to coercion from the state as _the people_ may seem appealing but even cursory examination shows this to be question begging.  The issue is who _ought_ be subject to the coercive force of the state and suggesting all those who _are_ is to argue for nothing more than the status quo.  The All-Affected Principle seem to commit us to enfranchising all humanity in some global state, a notion that a number of theorists have accepted [^goodin2007enfranchising].

Yet a global jurisdiction clashes with a number of democratic ideals, most notably autonomy and self determination.  The requirements of political equality and justice in a global jurisdiction are incompatible with national, regional or local self determination.  The diversity of values, needs and beliefs across humanity make it inevitable that different groups will support and require different laws and policies.  We might preference equality by granting exemptions or autonomy to some groups and not others based on their differing circumstances but can only do so at the expense of global jurisdiction.  Otherwise we might enforce uniform global rules but can only do so by ignoring the differing circumstances of individuals and groups.  Just, equal, or global. Pick any two.

Autonomy is another victim of the All-Affected Principle and is undermined by over inclusion just as much as under inclusion.  The mathematics of autonomy are relatively straight forward.  An agent's influence over any collective matter is a function of the number of others enfranchised, assuming political equality.  Formally:

>	i = f( 1/e )

If I have the only say in the matter, then I have full autonomy; whereas if I am one of many then my autonomy is diminished.  Provided that everyone who is enfranchised has some just claim to inclusion, then my reduced autonomy is not unjust and doesn't harm me in anyway. It is simply a reality of collective endeavours.  If however, others who don't have any just claim for inclusion are enfranchised, then my autonomy diluted by the addition of other voices in the same way as if my voice had been silenced.  The solution then, is to add some necessity condition such as the All-And-Only-Affected Principle.  But this merely returns us to the problem of issue based jurisdiction.

## Future Directions

Procedural accounts of democratic legitimacy succumb to paradoxes of founding from which they cannot recover.  Settling disputes regarding the limits of liberalism seem to rely on methods such as majoritarianism, deliberation or judgement according to some substantive ideal, which are themselves in dispute.  Substantive accounts of democratic legitimacy are unable to address the challenges raised by the Boundary Problem.

A system can only be justifiably labelled democratic iff a substantive proportion of its systems and procedures are in fact, democratic.  These bootstrap paradoxes I have examined show that a substantive number of these systems & procedures cannot be called democratic by any coherent interpretations of the term.  We seem to be left with the inevitable conclusion then, that democracy cannot be justifiably labelled democratic.

I still have a lot of work to do on this issue but my thoughts on future directions of my thesis roughly map the outline of this paper.  Part One will concentrate on historical and contemporary justifications of democracy: what is is, why its desirable and how it (supposedly) legitimised political authority.  Part Two will focus on the various bootstrap paradoxes that I have identified and developed.  Part Three will look at how these problems might be addressed.

Sorry but coherent solutions are still along way off.  I will however offer the following observations that may guide my future work.

1. Most conceptions of democracy seem to overlook or undervalue the idea of self rule.  Of course this is closely related to popular sovereignty but the latter seems to be missing an important element of autonomy that is intrinsic to self rule.  A greater focus on autonomy and collective autonomy as a key value should help provide us with stronger foundations.
2. Procedural accounts all fall foul of founding paradoxes.  But even substantive accounts need procedures to realise their substantive values.  If the procedure was also the substantive value, then we have a way to bootstrap democracy to legitimacy.
3. Solutions to the boundary problem like the All/Only Affected Principle are trying to do too much.  Normative democratic theory only needs to provide a coherent account of political authority.  There are a whole range of factors that may affect people that are outside the scope of political authority. The solution only needs to deal with a state's authority affecting you, not a state's actions per se.
