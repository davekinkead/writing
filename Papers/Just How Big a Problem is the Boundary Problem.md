# Just How Big a Problem is the Boundary Problem?

### Abstract


## Introduction


## What is the Boundary Problem

The story of democracy begins with the people.  Yet who is included amongst the people often predetermines the outcome of any democratic process.  When the legitimacy of democratic authority is dependent on the difference democratic, rather than non-democratic, processes bring about, the Boundary Problem demonstrates that the differences democracy authority is grounded upon are often purely arbitrary.
