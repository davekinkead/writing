# Is Consent Enough?

### Abstract

Debate about the role of consent in political obligation often centres on whether consent is a necessary condition for obligation.  Consent theorists argue that it is necessary whilst others propose alternative grounds for obligation such as fairness, gratitude or benefit.

While alternative accounts typically accept consent as one possible source of political obligation, it is consent theorists who object most strongly to consent as a sufficient condition for obligation.  Rawls thought obligation presupposed just institutions, Kant denied the binding force of immoral acts, and Locke rejected the possibility of alienating certain rights. 

In contrast to these theorists, I defend the position that consent, if it can be given, is sufficient to generate political obligations; before demonstrating that no current state can claim the consent of those governed has been given.  

## Introduction

- A brief survey of political obligation
- highlight explicit, implicit & hypothetical consent
- show were the debate is at

## Inalienability

Locke's Objection:

1. Certain rights are natural and inalienable.
2. Political obligations that violate those rights are non-binding.
3. Consent is not sufficient to generate political obligation.

Reply (The Assent/Consent Distinction):

1. Consent involves the granting of rights one already has to another who does not.
2. If a right is inalienable, it cannot be assigned.
3. One can assent to obligations that may not bind but one cannot consent to them.

## Just States

Rawls' Objection:

1. obligations to obey can only exist to just states.
2. consent to an unjust state can't generate obligations.
3. consent is not sufficient. 

Reply:

1. Just states don't need to be absolutely just
2. Unjust states can be still just to some
3. Consent is sufficient if it is just to me

## Immorality

Kant's Objection (following from Rawls'):

1. Promises to immoral acts are not binding
2.	Consenting is a type of promising
3.	Consent is not sufficient to generate political obligation.

Reply:

1. Obligations are not oughts, just reasons to consider
2. We can have obligations to unjust schemes yet ought not act to those ends
3. We ought not support injustice not because obligations to injustice are invalidated but rather because obligations to justice outweigh them

## What Counts as Consent?

- highlight existing problem with inferring consent
- contrast consent with coercion
- show consent to states is question begging & coercive.
- states can't claim consent while imposing costs for non-consent

Quotes:

Rawls (ToJ p302) - "acquiescence in, or even consent to, clearly unjust institutions does not give rise to obligations, â€¦ obligatory ties presuppose just institutions."
