## Arse About Face

**Adjective, Adverb**

_(idiomatic, UK, Australia)_

1.	In a manner that is opposite to or the reverse of the way it should be, backwards.
2.	Arranged in a confused or haphazard way; muddled.

I should probably start with a clarification of terms for anyone not yet blessed by their exposure to the linguistic beauty that is Australian slang.  _Arse-about-face_ is an anglo-australian colloquialism that means to get things backwards.  As in, "that Rawls fella has got this whole political liberalism thing arse about face".

---

So the thesis I'm going to defend in this paper is that liberalism get things backwards.  Or to use another Australian term-of-art, _skew if_.  More specifically though, I'm going to argue that that the project of political liberalism approaches the problem of stability within liberal democratic regimes the wrong way.  That hoping for the long term stability of liberal democracies given pluralism is a lost cause.

Rather than attempt to monkey patch political liberalism onto a pluralist polity of fixed boundaries, I'm going to argue we should instead define the very boundaries of our political associations based on what ever overlapping consensus of liberal values we can find.

---

In Part One of this paper, I'm going to briefly outline problem that Rawls' hoped Political Liberalism would address.  I'll show why Rawls was justifiably concerned about the stability of liberal regimes in the face of plurality, before showing why his and subsequent accounts of political liberalism have failed to adequately address his concerns.

In Part Two, I'll argue why we should approach the problem of liberalism in the face of diversity from a different dimension.....

While in Part Three, I'll address likely objections to my account.

## Rawls' Problem

The genesis of Rawls' _Political Liberalism_ was the inadequacy of _A Theory of Justice_ in dealing with a plurality of reasonable comprehensive doctrines concerning justice and a conception of the good.  

Much of _Theory_ was predicated on a Kantian conception of liberalism.  In the _Theory_, Rawls attempts reconcile liberty with equality by answering the questions of what is the most "appropriate conception of justice for specifying fair terms of social cooperation between citizens regarded as free and equal" [^rawls1996:3]. 

His answer is _Justice as Fairness_ and its two derivative principles of _liberty_ and _difference_.

---

Yet as Rawls himself recognised, a conception of political justice predicated upon a widely accepted comprehensive conception of the good was both highly unlikely and inherently unstable.

---

From a political-historical perspective, the spontaneous emergence of widespread comprehensive liberal values within a society appears to be highly unlikely.  Broad endorsement of a comprehensive liberal doctrine is a relatively recent phenomenon within the West, and can be seen as a gradual evolution of thought and value since the enlightenment, shaped by political institutions, culture and social norms.  It is not something that just happens overnight or arrives at the doorstep one morning.

---

Yet contemporary history demonstrates the fragility of comprehensive liberal doctrines even within constitutionally liberal regimes.  The rise of European fascism in the 1930s, 1960s, and today the emergence of parties like Golden Dawn in Greece, are just a few examples of how the evolution of comprehensive liberalism is not a monotonic, or unidirectional, process.

---

But liberalism itself is inherently unstable.  As a doctrine of liberty that respects, enables, and promotes a plurality of views politically, philosophically, and morally, liberalism sows the seeds of its own destruction.  

Liberal regimes lead to not just a diversity of competing liberal conceptions of the good, but also of opposing and irreconcilable beliefs, illiberal yet still perfectly reasonable; something Rawls saw as the "inevitable long run result of the powers of human reason at work within the background of enduring free institutions" [^rawls1996:4].

---

More problematically, it seems that the most important issues for many people - theology, science, the good - are the most intractable, leading Rawls to worry that "we should find it remarkable that, so deeply opposed in these ways, just cooperation among free and equal citizens is possible at all" [^rawls1996:4]

--- 

So the idea of _Justice as Fairness_ as outlined in the _Theory_, was predicated on a stable liberal democratic regime, itself based upon a  Kantian flavour of comprehensive liberalism.  The result of this however, would be reasonable pluralism, including reasonable illiberal doctrines.  It was, Rawls' notes, reliant on a "premise the realisation of which it's principles of justice ruled out" [^ralws1996:xvi]

---

## Political Liberalism

Rawls attempts to address the problem of stability in _Theory_ by distinguishing a political conception of justice from a comprehensive one.  He shifts the focus of enquiry from how can a society best determine a concept of justice, to how can a just and stable society of equals exist over time when its citizens are profoundly divided by reasonable pluralism.

---

Much of the normative work of political liberalism is done by the notion of a political conception of justice, a freestanding moral doctrine directed at the basic institutions of society, informed by, yet prior to, individual comprehensive conceptions of justice.

A society's collective political conception is derived by the _Idea of an Overlapping Consensus_ and the _Idea of Public Reason_.

---

The Idea of Public Reason
- shapes, guides, discovers reasons we can all agree with

---

The idea of Overlapping Consensus
- consensus, agreement for the right reasons

---

Show objections to Rawls

- A modus vivendi is unstable because parties are not committed to liberal values.
- Stable liberalism requires consensus.  We must be committed to liberal values for it to be stable.
- But consensus requires shared liberal values which trump any conflicting comprehensive values - we must be sufficiently liberal.
- Convergence accounts can't overcome modus vivendi instability. We need to know others are committed to liberalism.
- Our comprehensive doctrines must either be subordinate to, or compatible with political liberalism.
- Attempts to idealise 'reasonableness' simply import liberal values.

---

Show improvements to political liberalism

- Quong 
  - alters the conception of 'reasonable' to improve likelihood of consensus
	- this comes at the cost of stability because we now need to impose liberalism on a greater number of 'unreasonable' people who disagree
	
---

- Gaus
	- argues for a convergence account - agreement for any reason
	- this comes at a cost of not addressing modus vivendi claims

## Liberalism's Boundaries

The boundaries of political associations within liberal theory have typically been taken to be exogenous to analysis.  Liberal theory focuses inward, to the rights, duties, and distribution of primary goods within a society.

In liberal theories with pre-political geneses such as Locke's, people "incorporate and make one body politic" by agreeing to the "bonds of civil society" ...  "This any number ... may do because it injures not the freedom of the rest" [^locke1690:8-96]

And liberal theories with societal geneses have a similar inward focus.  In _Theory_, Rawls begins with the idea of a society before examining how it ought be organised. In _Political Liberalism_, he makes this explicit: 

"that the basic structure is that of a closed society: that is, we are to regard it as self-contained and as having no relations with other societies." [^rawls1996:12]

--- 

The inward focus of political liberalism is driven not by theoretical necessity, but rather by simplicity.  As Rawls notes, it is an "abstraction, justified only because it enables us to focus on certain main questions free from distracting details." [^rawls1996:12] 

Of course, this is not to say that Rawls ignores outward relations between peoples. "At some point a political conception of justice must address just relations between peoples" [^ralws1996:12] something which he does address in _The Laws of Peoples_.

But Rawls is explicit that these outward relations are not governed by the same principles as inward ones.  In _Laws_ .....

---

His outward focused account of international relations, _The Laws of People_, while certainly inspired by liberal values, is not a liberal doctrine.  Rather, it concerns itself with the relations between what Rawls calls decent people.

The liberal theory that underpins _Theory_ and _Political Liberalism_ is expressly disavowed when focus is cast outwards.  Rawls denies that the Difference Principle applies between states and peoples, preferring a threshold based _Duty of Assistance_ owed by 'well-ordered peoples' to assist other societies to become part of the society of well-ordered peoples. [cite!]

He also denies requirements of equality...

---

Its easy to describe why this might be the case, why we typically take the units political association to be fixed and why the primacy of our focus is on relationship within that fixed entity.

- In The Law of Peoples,( Rawls aims to derive the laws to which well- ordered peoples would agree.
- Charles Beitz and Thomas Pogge have argued that liberty principle and difference principle from _Theory_ should apply to all people globally.
- Rawls rejects this as he argues different principles would be chosen by different peoples

---

So rather than attempt to cajole a conception of political liberalism upon a fixed polity divided by a pluralism of comprehensive doctrines, I propose a new account of how Rawls' problem can be solved - employ the idea of Overlapping Consensus as the determining criteria of the boundaries of our political associations.





Explain 'arse about face'

Thesis:  That accounts of political liberalism are self defeating when the boundaries of the polity are considered stable or exogenous to analysis.

## Part One - How it is self defeating

1. Liberalism tends towards instability. 

	- Liberalism permits and entails illiberal beliefs.
	- Introduce Rawls' problem - stable liberalism amongst reasonable pluralism.
	- Take it further - stable liberalism amongst unreasonable pluralism.

2. Political (Public Reason) Liberalism requires support from comprehensive liberal doctrines to be stable.

	- A modus vivendi is unstable because parties are not committed to liberal values.
	- Stable liberalism requires consensus.  We must be committed to liberal values for it to be stable.
	- But consensus requires shared liberal values which trump any conflicting comprehensive values - we must be sufficiently liberal.
	- Convergence accounts can't overcome modus vivendi instability. We need to know others are committed to liberalism.
	- Our comprehensive doctrines must either be subordinate to, or compatible with political liberalism.
	- Attempts to idealise 'reasonableness' simply import liberal values.

3. When the bounds of a liberal polity is fixed, then not all reasonable people will hold comprehensive liberal doctrines

	- From 1)

4. Therefore Political Liberalism is self defeating.

## Part Two - What to do about it 

1. Liberalism and boundaries

	- Liberalism's assumption of a polity.
	- Liberalism's neglect of the other.
	- The current sets of overlapping and divergent values.
	
2. Allow an overlapping consensus to define the boundaries of the polity.

3. With fluid boundaries, agreement rather than consensus is all that is necessary.

	- Convergence in fixed boundaries fails because we need to know others are committed to liberal values.
	- But with fluid boundaries, others don't need to be committed to liberal values.
	- Convergence is sufficient with fluid boundaries.
	
## Objections

1. Plausibility - States are here to stay.

	- Naturalistic fallacy.  
	- Static states are not necessary, they merely dominant political thought contingently.
	- We have injustice now, so why then put forward a theory of justice?

3. Threat of Balkanisation - Won't this lead to disintegration of societies

	- It will certainly lead to political decentralisation but not disintegration.
	- Static polities can only get consensus on a very narrow range of issues. (Range vs Coverage)
	- Fluid polities can achieve consensus a much broader range 

2. How do we deal with others

	- Same as now
	- Liberalism doesn't offer us much in this regard.
