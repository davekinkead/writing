#Against a Pluralism of Authority


It is not a useful aim of philosophers or political thinkers to determine which account of political authority is the right one. Or at least so says Tom Christiano.[^1]

But Tom is wrong.  Determining which account of authority is the right or appropriate one is a critical aim of political philosophy.  Without doing so, we are condemned to the conflation of the very terms and ideas which we endeavour to unpack and explain; we can all too easily fail prey to fallaciously applying the justification of one conception of authority to a differing instance of another; and of course, some of our accounts may be just plain wrong.

{{Examples of the problem perhaps here}}

Contemporary accounts of authority can be broadly classified to accounts concerning the legitimacy of coercion, the imposition of duties upon others, or the right to rule.  Beneath these classifications, conceptions of authority can framed the issue from a variety of perspectives.[^1]

First, there is the distinction between theoretical and practical authority.  The former gives us reasons to believe while the latter gives us reasons to act. When the physicist tells us that the universe is expanding because the further a galaxy is from us, the faster is it moving away from us, he gives us a reason to believe.  When the police officer instructs to step out of the vehicle, he gives us a reason to act.  Typical accounts of political authority hold that the two are distinct (cf Hurd for a notable exception) although I will argue against this later.

Another distinction is that between power and authority. Power can be thought of as simply the ability to realise one's objectives, and can manifest itself as either soft, i.e. persuasive, or hard, i.e. backed by threat of force.  An salesperson may realise her goals through the skilled use of psychology and rhetoric while a criminal may achieve his ends via force or threat thereof; yet in neither of these instances, would we claim that they have authority over us.  

But authority without power is a largely vacuous concept.  An exiled prince may claim to the the rightful heir to his estranged kingdom, yet without the ability to realise his will, he can be describes at best as an authority in name only.  Authority is more than power, but former requires the latter.  Various drug cartels may exercise their power of large swathes of Latin America without any authority, yet when the state cannot effectively maintain public order it has lost its authority regardless of its normative claim to it.

Authority can also be thought of in a description or normative sense, what Wolff [^woolf1970defense] describes as *de facto* and *de jure* authority. De facto authority occurs whenever (sufficient) people acknowledged it to exist.  The state commands, people comply because it is the state, therefore the state has de facto authority.  De jure authority however, only occurs when we have legitimate reasons for obeying.  Whilst Hobbes may have claimed that the ability to rule gave the Prince the right to rule, most conceptions of authority recognise this descriptive/normative distinction and the major project of political philosophy seems to be eliciting this dichotomy and outlining the conditions of when we ought obey.

A further dimension to authority is the degree of its extent.  Authority may be absolute, like that of a totalitarian dictator and extend to all spheres of life.  Or it may be limited in scope of domain.  We may talk of legislative, executive, judicial, statutory, or moral authority, all of which are simultaneously held by different individuals or institutions.

The source of authority is another dimension that contrasts the various contemporary accounts.  The authority of the state has been variously argued to stem from our consent (Locke), its preferability to the state of nature (Hobbes), its concern for all (Mill), or its epistemic superiority (Estlund). Furthermore, our duties and obligations to obey edits of the state may be owed to the state itself, to others or ourselves, while the nature of duties to others may be as citizens qua persons or citizens qua citizens (Simmons).

This pluralism leads to conflict.  Accounts such as Locke's, that de jure authority is practical, derived from the consent of its subjects, and grants the state the right to rule so long as it protects the liberty of its subjects, require very different justificatory claims and lead to considerably different conclusions about the legitimacy of actual states than does say, Raz's account, where by de jure authority imposes an obligation to obey just in case by following its directives, it is likely to better comply with reasons which apply to him if he accepts the directives of the alleged authority as authoritatively binding and tries to follow them, rather than by trying to follow the reasons which apply to him directly.

So we are at a crossroad.  We can either accept a pluralism of accounts of authority and the associated conflict of this approach, or we can attempt to reconcile the varying conceptions of authority into a single, comprehensive account.  I choose the latter.

In order to avoid the charge of defining my way axiomatically to my conclusions, it is necessary to state the conditions under which my account will fail: namely, when a plurality of accounts better encapsulates the essence of authority than my singular one.  Ceteris paribus, a theory in which a single account better explains a phenomenon is superior to one in which multiple accounts are required to do the same.  If the singular account is deficient however, then multiple accounts are preferable.

To develop my account, I will employ four prototypical examples of authority: the Expert, the Pope, the Courts, the State. If I can show that my singular account holds for all, then I believe it to have sufficiently steady legs. But first I wish to narrow the field.

I claimed earlier that accounts of authority are broadly justifications of legitimate coercion, impositions of duties to obey, or the right to rule.  On reflection however, there are only two.  The right to rule, is simply nothing more than the combination of the other two.  Rights are corollaries of duties and without the ability to impose duties upon its subjects, an authority's right to rule is vacuous.  That right is equally vacuous without the ability to coerce those who disobey.  Without the ability to enforce the duties it imposes, legitimate claims authority cannot be distinguished from illegitimate ones.

But legitimate coercion without the ability to impose duties or obligations to obey is also problematicâ€¦ {{need to explain this later}}


It is widely acknowledged that authorities give reasons.  Reasons to do, to be, to believe, and to act.  The Expert tells us the universe is expanding; the Pope proclaims the moral impermissibility of same sex relations; the Court declares flag burning a constitutional right; and the State says pay your taxes or go to gaol.  

All these reasons are theoretical.  While the Expert's is clearly a reason to believe, most accounts hold the remainder to be reasons to act.  But in claiming a distinction between action and belief, these accounts deny the intrinsic relation between authority and autonomy.  Authoritative actions are not simply demands for a pavlovian response.  They are, rather, demands that we obey despite our possible or likely objections.  We are to pay our taxes despite our preference to keep the money ourselves; to respect the speech acts of others; or to not respect their sexual orientation. They require us to first believe we ought, in order to act.

Yet the giving of reasons alone is not sufficient to be an authority.  The rouge offers us our money or our life; the infomercial invites us to order now to receive a free set of steak knives; the t-shirt tells us don't worry be happy.  Anyone, or anything, can give reasons to think or act but authority requires something more.  

Authority requires sufficient competence relating to the reasons it gives.  We accept an authority because it is in someway, more competent than we are.  We believe the Expert, simply because she in an expert, because we acknowledge her superior competence in a particular field.  We believe the Pope on homosexuality but only if we believe in his superior access to a divine source of morality.  We believe we ought pay our taxes because acknowledge some social or political duty, or that we will be imprisoned if we don't.  Our grounds for accepting an authority relate to the superior competence of the authority, not to the reasons themselves.

In contrast, if the competence of the authority is not sufficiently superior, we do not accept its reasons. If we ourselves are experts, we may concur with the Expert but in virtue of the facts rather than deference to her expertise.  If we reject the moral superiority of the Church, then the Pope's reasons seem little more than the confused utterances of an old man.  If we think the state has no special competence in determining our duties to others, then our compliance with the its commands is either coincidental or base self preservation.

Authority then, is simply the giving of reasons, whilst having sufficient competency for giving those reasons.  

Now, to deal with legitimate coercion as a separate concept ...
