Democracy: Any system of government whose 1) claim to sovereignty is derived from the will of the people, and 2) where procedures exists for those those subjected to the claims of political authority to have some degree of influence over those claims.

Sovereignty is simply the claim of legitimate political authority over another - the right to rule and the right to be obeyed.  The will of the people must be the source of sovereignty as non-democratic regimes may still claim they act in the interests of the people.

Fulfilling 1) but not 2) makes a government an empty or rhetorical democracy like China or the USSR.  Fulfilling 2) but not 1) makes a regime an informal democracy (???).

Autonomy is central to the human condition.

Deny the autonomy of another, by imposing your will over theirs against their wishes, is to deny their humanity.

Of course, the immediate objection is that there are many instances where the simple interact of agents with conflicting views or values results in at least one of their wills being denied.

If I can't realise my autonomy without denying it in another, then this notion of humanity is not universalisable to humanity.

But this object only bites if the antecedent is true. What if this conflict of autonomy wasn't necessary?
