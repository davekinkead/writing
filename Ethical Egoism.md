# Ethical Egoism

Accounts of utilitarianism are typically justified along the following lines:

1.  We are all strongly motivated by feelings of pleasure & pain, happiness & sadness etc.  Call these positive feelings the Good.
2.  All things considered, more happiness and pleasure is better than less
3.  Therefore act in a way that increases the Good for you.
4.  But we have no reason to think that our happiness is more important or deserving than that of another
5.  Therefore act in a way that increases the Good for all.

Universal consequentialism requires us to not just sometime put the happiness of others ahead of our own happiness, it requires us to _always_ be impartial to the subject of happiness, a requirement that leads to intuitively absurd positions.

But this line of reason strikes me as fallacious.  Even after accepting universal equality of agent as required by (4), the leap to (5) is too great for the argument to be valid.  All the universality proviso requires is that we accept the equal claim of others to their own happiness, that there is nothing objectively or intrinsically special about our particular brand of happiness.  It does not require that _we_ impartially value their happiness equally to ours.

...Time & self...

Rather, it entails the following position

>   Act in a way that increases your own happiness over time, whilst recognising others claim to do the same.

From here, we can see that certain actions are compatible with mutual egoism, whilst others are not.  A classical prisoner's dilemma has arisen where by our actions can increase or decrease the happiness of others and their actions affect us similarly.  We can model this in standard form:

    3,3 | 0,5
    ---------
    5,0 | 1,1

We can act in a mutually beneficial manner (mutual cooperation) which rewards us equally, help ourselves that the expense of others (defect/cooperate), or engage in mutual harm (mutual defection).  The actual amounts modelled are inconsequential, only their relative differences matter.

Game theory demonstrates that in an iterative prisoner's dilemma, the dominant strategy is tit-for-tat - assume cooperation and then reciprocate the other's move this round in the next.  It is a strategy of long-term rational self-interest but simultaneously one that reflects our moral intuitions well.  We prefer kindness and cooperation, but crave justice and retribution.

We might say then, that the right action is therefore one that corresponds with the maxim:
