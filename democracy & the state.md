On a Voluntary State

The purpose of this post is to argue that a necessary condition of legitimacy for the state is the provision of a means of succession.  My argument makes two assumptions that I take for granted and will not defend here: that everyone has an equal claim to consideration from the state; and that the purpose of the state is to shape collective action.

So then how do we justify the imposition of the state?  The obvious answer is that collective action is often advantageous to individual action.

List consequentialist arguments
- monopoly on violence to stop violence
- limit freedoms to ensure freedoms
- the greater good
-

List intrinsic arguments.
