# Cooperation and its Obligation

Why _ought_ we cooperate?  Are there any reasons beyond self interest?

A fundamental and unchallenged assumption in political theory is that _we_ - the people, the nation, the state - must cooperate in some consistent manner.  _We_ must all be guided by the same norms, follow the same rules, and be bound by the same laws.  Political identity demands normative consistency.

And there are strong reasons for demanding this consistency.

# The Problem with Liberalism

Pluralism exists. People believe dumb things.  Unreasonable people wont be convinced by reasoned argument.

The problem with liberalism is that seeks to impose, via a largely rational and reasonable process, a set of rules that everyone must follow without offering reasons why we _all_ must cooperate.  

Liberalism requires wide spread consensus in order for it to be liberal.  Without broad agreement, liberalism is nothing more than a form of elitist dictatorship where the beliefs of those with the power to impose them trample the belief of those lacking power to resist.

But the fact of diversity means that there will never be universal agreement to these rules - there will always be disagreement.  The liberal response is to use public reason to justify these beliefs to other reasonable people, while those who remain recalcitrant are therefore unreasonable.

Yet no one ever believes themselves to be unreasonable.  If one is reasonable, then one can see this or perhaps err towards caution and question their own reasonableness.  But the unreasonable never do this..

Liberalism fails to explain why we have obligations to help realise other's ends.  Universal cooperation is demonstrably unnecessary to realise the majority of the ends we all share.

If there is a large overlapping agreement about ends, then imposed cooperation is not necessary and self-interest is sufficient.

# Reasonability and Rationality

What is the relation between reasonability and rationality?  Are they equivalent or synonymous? Can one be reasonable but irrational, or rational but unreasonable?

Given the same evidence, it seems that all rational people must agree on the facts of any matter.  If I logically deduce X from Y, then given X Y must be the case.  If you are also rational, then give X you must also deduce Y (or at least not deduce not Y).

Reasonableness however, seems to involve the admitting of other viable possibilities that one disagrees with, which in turn seems to relate to matters of value.  I may be convinced that lime-pistachio sorbet is the best flavour of gelate by far, but it would be unreasonable of me to deny that others may have differing tastes that are equally as valid.

Only the reasonable can doubt their own reasonability.  The rationality of thought can only be assessed rationally. If one is irrational, then one lacks the cognitive framework with which to assess this irrationality.  The irrational person either falsely believes that they are rational or simple isn't concerned with the matter.

If one is rational, then one cannot remain unreasonable once one is aware of that unreasonableness.  A criterion of reasonableness requires one to simple give up unreasonable positions.

The irrational and unreasonable deny their status or simple don't care.

Back to Liberalism....liberalism requires consensus.  If consensus cannot be reached, then the dissenters must be unreasonable. But those dissenters see themselves as reasonable.  So in order for liberalism to avoid the charge of elitist imposition or circularity, it must first reach consensus on what reasonableness means to all parties.  And given the nature of pluralism, this will not happen.
