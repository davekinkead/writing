What kind of a liberal are you?

The term 'liberal' is a confusing one.  In Australia, conservatives tend to vote Liberal, while those who Americans call liberal would vote for anything but.  Deep down though, we are all liberals, because we all value liberty.

The story of how we can all start from a single point of agreement but end up at vastly different ideologies is an intriguing one.  In 1000 words, I'll plot how slight changes in how important we think equality is to ensuring freedom can takes us from the far right to far left of the political spectrum.
