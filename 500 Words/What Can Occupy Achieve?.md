# What can Occupy achieve?

I’m rather sympathetic to Occupy movement.  Disenfranchised citizens are flexing their democratic muscle and the status quo is becoming worried.  Yet as it stands, Occupy is unlikely to achieve any meaningful change if it continues it’s current course of action.

Why? Because they wont achieve the same level of popular support and participation …
Because they aren’t using a dominant strategy

Any government that claims to be democratic can only be justified by the consent of those it governs.  While the overthrown Arab dictatorships could never claim this kind of legitimacy, Western states can.  Their governments were elected by popular vote under universal suffrage and until they are voted out, this justification remains.

The problem for the disenfranchised and dissatisfied is that no real alternatives are being offered. Party based parliamentary systems are by their very nature predisposed to creating the problems we face today so what every party or group wins the next election, the problems will remain.

Neither are revolution, violence or force viable options.  Overthrowing the current government and installing whatever marxist/socialist/anarchist/communist utopian come bureaucratic dictatorship will simply create different problems and be subject to the same accusation - without consent it cant be legitimate.

So what can Occupy do?  The first step would be to employ a dominant strategy.  Our constitutional frameworks are designed to favour
