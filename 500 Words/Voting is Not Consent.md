Voting is Not Consent
=====================  

It is often argued that in voting during an election, we are consenting to the authority of the winning party.  The victory, whether politician or party, is said to be given a mandate by the people to implement the promises they made during the preceding campaign.  (who, when? give examples)

The account can be summarised as follows:

1.  Freely choosing something is the same as freely consenting to something.
2.	Voting for something 
3.

Voting is a process of collective decision making when individual choice is not available

Yet this account of choice and consent seems patently false.  Clearly, there are times when choosing _can_ be construed as consent.  If I'm offered a choice between cucumber chile paletas or blueberry lavender gelato for desert, then it seems perfectly reasonable to say that I consent to be served the whichever frozen treat I chose.  And the notion holds even when we move from individual to collective choice, if say due to catering constraints, the restaurant can only serve one dessert per table and the party we are with must voting on what we are all having.

But the account falls apart as soon as we leave the realm of icy sweets.  Imagine for a moment, that you've been kidnapped during your sleep and hauled before a modern day incarnation of the Spanish Inquisition.  You've been accused of witchcraft, and as you kneel before the tribunal in your bright orange jumpsuit, you are offered a simple choice: A short and merciful death if you admit your guilt, otherwise a slow and painful one should you contest the charges.  You're innocent and assuming, of course, both choices to be unpalatable and warrantless, neither choice could reasonably be taken to imply consent.

Clearly, for choice to be taken to imply consent certain characteristics must be present, with warrant and palatability providing us an excellent hint.  David Hume, for example, thought the harshness of the choice voided the possibility of consent.  Responding to John Locke's idea of consent in residency, he noted:

	We may as well assert, that a man, by remaining in a vessel, freely consents to the dominion of the master, though he was carried on board while asleep, and must leap into the ocean, and perish the moment he leaves her.
	- Of the Original Contract, 1748

Hume thought that it was the severity of the costs of non-consent that prevented choice from being consent.  Consent could not be implied by continued residency in a state because the only way to demonstrate non-consent was emigration, the cost of which was unreasonably high for the typical subject.  Yet there are many cases where the costs of non-consent are very high but one can still consent.  Imaging for a moment, you are suffering from some terminal illness and your only hope of survival is an experimental and painful procedure.  The costs of non-consent are clearly very high - if you don't consent, you will almost certainly die.  But assuming you are fully informed of the risks, in choosing the procedure you are evidently consenting to it.  Even Hume himself seemed to recognise this, allowing consent to bind obligations even under conditions of great severity:

	A man, dangerously wounded, who promises a competent sum to a surgeon to cure him, wou’d certainly be bound to performance
	- A Treatise of Human Nature, 1739, 3.2.5

The issue of warrant however, does seem decisive.  Painful choices don't void consent, at least when the costs of non-consent are warranted.  Let us return for a moment to the Spanish Inquisition.  Imaging this time however, that you have in fact been engaging in witchcraft, in a jurisdiction in which witchcraft is illegal, and that the just and reasonable punishment for you offence is 5 years hard labour.  The tribunal offers you a different choice: 5 years hard labour or 10 years of house arrest.  Now, I would argue, the conditions are such that your choice can be construed as consent, precisely because the costs of non-consent are warranted.  Whether you prefer a shorter, severer punishment, or a longer, more comfortable one, you are free to select that which best matches your preferences.

Which brings us to a dilemma for voting and consent.  States don't just claim authority over those who voted for one party or another, they claim authority over those who don't even vote.  For voting to be consent, the costs of non-consent must be warranted - there must be some justification as to why we must vote in the first place and why the state have authority over you even if you don't vote [^1]. But as Nicolas Maloberti [^2] points out, under consent theory, that justification can only from the consent of the governed ie those who vote.  We are left with a self-referential fallacy where the the legitimacy of the state over all its subjects, requires some prior legitimacy to require all its subject to vote, but which can only come about if the state doesn't impose costs of non-consent ie claim authority over those who don't vote. 

[^1]: The cost of not voting isn't just a fine in countries with compulsory voting, it's the fact that laws will still apply to you even if you don't vote.
