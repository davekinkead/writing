# Reciprocal Autonomy

A major problem in political theory is both explaining and justifying why we should cooperate and operate as a society.  There are a number of ways this problem has been approached from, such as communitarianism or egoistic self interest, but today I want to explore a hopefully novel and coherent approach that embraces the voluntary nature of philosophical anarchism without succumbing to the objections of other accounts.

A key part of the human condition is the experience of agency.  We all have first hand, daily experience of our own autonomy - the ability to direct our actions ourselves.  Now whether or not we are actually autonomous is irrelevant.  It may be the case that we live in a strongly deterministic universe where every action is nothing but the cumulation of previous actions and our experience of agency is nothing but an illusion.  All that matters however, is that we feel agency and claim to be autonomous.

As (claimed) autonomous beings, we claim to be free - as in capability - to make demands of others.  It is within our power to demand that others do what we says, although it's a different matter entirely whether or not we can actually make others do this.  And just as its within our power to demand others do what we say, it is within our power to refrain from doing so.

Dworkin[^1] notes that we all want to be dictators, to achieve our ends and have others do what we demand.  Yet clearly it is impossible for everyone or even a few of us to be dictators.  Baring any significant inequality of talent or means, the only mutually satisfactory solution for collective endeavours between us is some form of equality.

Yet this equality can take many forms. Dworkin himself suggests a form of recognised political equality is necessary but other conceptions of equality such as the Golden Rule can also work.  And it is in that vein that I propose the notion of _reciprocal autonomy_ as the normative basis of political cooperation.

Reciprocal autonomy, simply stated, is the willingness to recognise the self determination of others on the proviso that they recognise yours.  By accepting this principle as the normative basis of society, an agent recognises the possibility of, but not the obligation for, political cooperation. It is the minimum criteria necessary for cooperation as equals, below which we reject the very possibility of collective endeavours.  By embracing it, we give up all prima facie claims of authority over others who do the same for us.  It means treating others as political equals at the most fundamental level.

So what? Why would someone want to give up the claim to tell others what to do?  Well firstly, the reciprocity in the principle means you wont have to deal with others claiming you ought do what they want.  More importantly however, it provides a normative foundation of political cooperation that avoids the problems of legitimacy and authority that every other political theory has been plagued with.

Of course, reciprocal autonomy is not sufficient for a society to exist.  For that, other mechanisms of cooperation, coordination, arbitration and assurance are needed.  Neither does it tell us how to deal with those who refuse to recognise our own self determination.  Like liberalism, reciprocal autonomy is a restraining principle on our own actions yet unlike liberalism, it is one that cannot be imposed upon us but rather must be freely accepted.
