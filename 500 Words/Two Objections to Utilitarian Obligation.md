Two Objections to Utilitarian Obligation
========================================

Explicitly utilitarian accounts of political obligation are quite rare in contemporary political theory. Hume, Benthem & Mill certainly put forward utilitarian accounts in response to Locke's problematic account based on tacit consent……

My first objection is to utilitarian accounts of obligation in general.  The notion of obligation, at least in the vernacular, seems largely incompatible with consequentialism of any form.  It seems incongruent to simultaneously have a duty to obey the law and maximise the good whenever obeying the law decreases net social utility.  In this case, our duty to the law would be contingent on the law increasing utility but then the question must be asked, what normative work is our duty to the law actually doing if it only exists when compatible with our broad duty to maximise or increase the common good?

Some utilitarians such as XXX and YYY have suggested that compatiblist accounts whereby obeying the law is a prima facie duty…..

My second, and more ZZZ objection to utilitarian accounts of political obligation can also be applied to accounts of obligation based on received benefit.  These can be explicit, such as  HHH, or incorporated into related accounts, such as Rawls' doctrine of fair play.


- act utilitarianism is incompatible with obligation and duty
- obligation to 'good government' binds me to all good governments
