#You call this a Democracy?

Thesis: we need to be clear about democracy if our dialog is to be meaningful

Democracy is the worst form of government, execpt for all the others we've tried from time to time[^1]. It's both the road to socialism[^5] and path to liberty[^6].  It's the process by which the people are free to choose the person who will get the blame[^2], and the device that ensures we shall be governed no better than we deserve[^3]. Politicians simulatinously label compulsory voting both 'democratic' and 'undemocratic'[^7], while polticial theorists even talk of 'democratising democracy'[^8]. What ever it is, it abundantly clear that 'democracy' means many things to many people.  

And yet when a term means everything, it means nothing. 'Democratic' has become the catch all term of modern politics, the rallying cry for some vague notion of warm an fuzzy good government.  The term has become so nebulous these days that to argue some policy is bad because it is 'undemocratic' is to say nothing more than it's bad because it's bad.  If we ever hope to move our political debate beyond loudly shouting past each other, then we need to get clear about what we mean by 'democracy'. 

## Popular Sovereignty

The eytomology of the word offers us some help.  Democracy is derived from the Greek...... Rule by the people......

But a what would a government of the people, by the people and for the people actually look like? Totalitarian democracy
