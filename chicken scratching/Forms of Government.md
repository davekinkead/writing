# Forms of Government

There are a number of ways we can conceptualise politics and government. The following outlines some various dimensions:


##Dimensions


**Diffusion**

- Anarchy <--> Autocracy <--> Oligarchy <--> Polyarchy


**Scope**

- Anarchy <--> Liberalism <--> Authoritarianism <--> totalitarianism. 
- The extent of government involvement in various aspects of society.

**Atomicity**

- Unitary <--> Imperial <--> Federation <--> Confederation
- The extent that autonomy is localised or centralised. Cooperations extends over a single atomic polity or many.
- Unitary. A state governed as a single unit with any administrative areas deriving authority from the central power.
- Imperial. A single power joining and governing multiple diverse political units, typically via conquest.
- Federation. A union of partly self governing political units where authority is formally shared between the central and component governments.
- Confederation. A voluntary union of self governing political units where some authority is delegated to the central government to support the aims of all member units. 

**Sovereignty** 

- Anarchy <--> Popular <--> Anocrcacy <--> Limited <--> Absolute
- The degree to which the exercise of power separated or constrained by checks & balances.  
- The degree that one authority may be contradicted by another.



**Distribution of rights**

- equal vs unequal. 
- The extent to which members have similar political rights and obligations in a society.

**Institutionalisation of power**

-  institutional vs anocratic. 
- The degree that political power is held in public vs private hands.




**Questions**

- what's the difference between liberalism and anarchism?
- what's the difference between monarchy and autocracy? (autocrat is a monarch with absolute sovereignty)

**Ruled By**

## Democracies


Decisions

Equality


Autonomy


- Consensus democracy – democratic rule based on consensus rather than traditional majority rule.
- Constitutional democracy – democracy governed by a constitution.
- Delegative (liquid) democracy – a form of democratic control whereby voting power is vested in self-selected delegates, rather than elected representatives.
- Deliberative democracy – Democracy in which authentic deliberation, not only voting, is central to legitimate decision making. It adopts elements of both consensus decision-making and majority rule.
- Demarchy – has people randomly selected from the citizenry through sortition to either act as general governmental representatives or to make decisions in specific areas of governance (defense, environment, etc.)
- Direct democracy (classically termed pure democracy) – A type of democracy where the people govern directly.
- Illiberal democracy – has weak or no limits on the power of the elected representatives to rule as they please.
- Liberal democracy – representative democracy with protection for individual liberty and property by rule of law.
- Market democracy – another name for democratic capitalism, an economic ideology based on a tripartite arrangement of a market-based economy based predominantly on economic incentives through free markets, a democratic polity and a liberal moral-cultural system which encourages pluralism.
- Multiparty democracy – two-party system requires voters to align themselves in large blocs, sometimes so large that they cannot agree on any overarching principles.
- Non-partisan democracy – system of representative government or organization such that universal and periodic elections (by secret ballot) take place without reference to political parties.
- Open Democratic – system where the public decides how they should be governed and having power to continuously improving the system.
- Participatory democracy – involves more lay citizen participation decision making and offers greater political representation than traditional representative democracy, e.g., wider control of proxies others trust them with, to those who get directly involved and actually participate.
- Radical democracy – type of democracy that focuses on the importance of nurturing and tolerating difference and dissent in decision-making processes.
- Representative democracy – indirect democracy where sovereignty is held by the people's representatives.
- Soviet democracy or Council democracy – form of democracy where the workers of a locality elect recallable representatives into organs of power called soviets (councils.) The local soviets elect the members of regional soviets who go on to elect higher soviets.
- Totalitarian democracy – system of government in which lawfully elected representatives maintain the integrity of a nation state whose citizens, while granted the right to vote, have little or no participation in the decision-making process of the government.
