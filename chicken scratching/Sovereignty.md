Suffrage & Sovereignty
======================

Some Definitions
----------------

**May need to change sovereignty to political freedom**

Sovereignty is typically thought of as supreme authority with a territory [^Philpott2010].

Instead, I'm going to define sovereignty as the degree to which one agent (or group of agents) is not constrained by others.  This description has a number of consequences:

- Sovereignty is a spectrum from none to absoute, and is relative.  A prisoner, whose every action is controlled could be thought to have no sovereignty of action but maintain sovereignty of thought.

- Sovereignty is only constrained by other agents.  I may wish to be able to fly like a bird under my own power yet physical reality constrains my desires.  This is not a constraint on my sovereignty.  If however I could fly, and my desire to do so was constrained by some other agent (perhaps by clipping my wings), then my sovereignty would be diminished.

- From this, it follows that issues of sovereignty only arrise when I interact with other agents.  Were I a solipist, or otherwise alone in the world, then my sovereignty would be simultaneously absolute and irrelevant.


Suffrage
--------

My political freedom is a function of how much control & influence I have over collective choices.

The more people I share power with, the less political freedom I have.

All things equal, sharing political power with fewer people increases my political power.


Universal Suffrage
------------------

But I ought not be denied a say over matters that concern me.  To do so would be a clear case of tyranny.

The more say I have in a collect choice
