The Argument from Autonomy
--------------------------

P1 - Autonomy is good.  I think it is unproblematic to merely assert this when arguing within the liberal conception of politics. 

- What is the nature of autonomy? How does it relate to liberty, freedom, and means? Positive, negative, or republican?
- Does autonomy come in degrees or is it binary? 
- Why is it good?  
- How does personal autonomy relate to political autonomy?


P2 - Limiting autonomy is bad. From (1) it is bad because it limits a good.  There may be grounds for limiting autonomy but it seem wrong ceteris paribus.

- What are the limits to this? 
- Are there any exceptions?
- Does denying suffrage over issues that don't affect an agent limit their autonomy? (Key to my argument - No!)


P3 - Following from (1) and (2), we are committed to a minimalist scope polis wherever possible because this simultaneously maximises (1) and minimises (2). (scope of the state)

- Are there alternatives that satisfy (1) and (2)?
- Are we committed to an anarchist or liberal conception of state?


P4 - Some issues however must be political as they affect more than one agent and therefore require some form of political equality / democracy in the decision making processes.  (decision making process)

- if autonomy is necessary for democracy, then democracy requires a liberal scope.


C6 - From (2), if someone is affected by an decision, they must be granted suffrage (the sufficient condition)

P7 - Granting suffrage to those who aren't affected by a decision doesn't increases the non-affected agent's autonomy (1) but does decrease the affected agent's autonomy which is wrong (2).  

C8 - Therefore suffrage ought be limited to only those affected (the necessity condition)

Objections???

- do I mean autonomy, personal sovereignty, liberty or freedom here?
