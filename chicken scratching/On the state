The State

How do we justify the state? What is its purpose?

While it can mean more, the state is simply a manifestation of collective action.



The purpose of democracy is to:
- legitimise the state
- legitimise coercive force over a collective group
- produce sound collective decisions
- encourage human flourishing

Democracy has been justified on the following grounds:
- intrinsic value

- consequentialist value
 - epistemic superiority (Condorcet's jury theorem)
 - structural superiority (everyone's needs must be considered)


The purpose of suffrage is to:
- ensure equal consideration is given to all parties
- to prevent tyranny

Universal suffrage fails to achieve both objectives:
- the equal consideration of all parties does not reflect the unequal interest of those parties.
- when consideration is given to those who hold no interest, tyranny is imposed upon those who do.

Legitimate material interest ought to be a necessary condition of suffrage in any system that seeks to be democratic
