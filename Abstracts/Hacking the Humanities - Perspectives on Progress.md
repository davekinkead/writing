# Hacking the Humanities: Moral Imperatives for Technological Progress

**Dave Kinkead, University of Queensland (HPRC)**

## Abstract

Emergent developments in information technology threaten to profoundly shift and destabilise processes and hierarchies within the academy.  The confluence of ubiquitous internet access, open data standards, distributed version control systems, and simplified text protocols radically shift the dynamics of how scholars research, write and publish.  Yet important questions surrounding the impact of this progress remain, and cannot be answered by technology itself.  To whom do academics owe the benefits of progress?  What obligations do we have to embrace, support, or actively realise further progress?  

My paper will briefly survey the most significant emerging technologies that are likely to impact scholars before investigating what reasons may underpin moral imperatives for technological progress within academia.  I examine how distributed version control like git and text protocols like markdown transform personal and collaborative workflows for scholars, as well as shift the informational constraints of publishing from one of scarcity to excess.  I then defend the claim that scholars ought not just utilise but also contribute to the realisation of technological benefits from both egoist and deontological perspectives.
