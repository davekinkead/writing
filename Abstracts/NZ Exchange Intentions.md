# NZ Exchange Intentions

In addition to representing UQ and HPRC at New Zealand's largest philosophy department, and presenting a paper that lays out the key arguments that will be pivotal to my thesis, some additional time to discuss relevant issues in democratic theory with member's of Auckland's Philosophy faculty would be most beneficial for my research.

Gillian Brock has an extensive publication record on issues relating to cosmopolitanism and global justice.  Accounts of cosmopolitanism, and specifically their justifications of political association that transcends nation-states, form an important part of my conception of Dynamic Federalism.  An opportunity for a detailed discussion of matters relating to cosmopolitan democracy with Gillian would be invaluable for my thesis.

Glen Pettigrove's work is concerned with the nature and moral significance of collectives.  Given that the key issue my thesis addresses is what justifies membership within a political collective, a chance to discuss his recent work on these matters would add additional breadth and depth to the normative component of my work.

Additionally, engaging with members of Auckland's Department of Political Studies would greatly enhance my progress.

Stephen Winter is a political theorist whose work focuses on deliberative democracy, legitimacy, and inclusion.  An opportunity to discuss his recent work on identity and citizenship would assist me to further develop my account of inclusion and exclusion within polities.

Katherine Smits has recently published a book 'Post-Nationalist Liberal Pluralism'.  A chance to discuss her revised liberal pluralist account for the political significance of sub-national identity group membership and arguments for group representation and deliberative liberalism would prove highly beneficial.

Given the depth of post-foundationalist political theorists at Auckland whose work aligns and intersects with the key themes I need to address in my thesis, I feel that my selection for NZ RHD Exchange would both reflect well on HPRC as well as being invaluable for my progress towards my next milestone.
