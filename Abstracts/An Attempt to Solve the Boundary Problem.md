# An Attempt to Solve the Boundary Problem

Keywords: Political Philosophy, Democracy, Citizenship, Autonomy

Just who _ought_ to comprise 'the people' within a polity, and how this should be determined, has been a problem that political theorists have wrestled with for over 40 years.  The inadequacies of extant solutions such as the All-Affected Principle and All-Subjected Principle, cast lingering doubts as to whether any account of democratic legitimacy can ever effectively stand upon an inadequate account of political membership.

In this paper I propose a novel solution to the Boundary Problem, comprising a normative component, the Principle of Reciprocal Autonomy, and an instrumental component, Dynamic Federalism.  Together, I argue that these two concepts allow us to overcome the problem of how to legitimate membership within a polity, whilst offering a mechanism of political association that is both plausible and realisable.
