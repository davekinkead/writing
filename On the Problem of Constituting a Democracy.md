# On the Problem of Constituting a Democracy (the Boundary Problem)


Democracy is a form of collective decision making and governance amongst some specified group of agents.

This issue of just which agents constitute ‘the people’ for democratic decision making is logically prior to how those agents participate in a democracy.

The problem of constituting the demos or boundary cannot therefore be solved by democratic means.

----

Democratic theory makes claims of legitimacy, often to the exclusion of other political theories.

A political theory that wants to claim legitimacy must ensure that its processes don’t lead to arbitrary outcomes. 

Who constitutes the people often predetermines the outcome of any democratic process which has the potential to render democratic outcomes arbitrary.

The (non-democratic) process used to constitute a democracy must itself be legitimate if democratic theory is to make claims of political legitimacy.

----

All existing attempts to solve the boundary problem have been inadequate for democratic theory to make claims of legitimacy:

Existing Boarders

Existing boarders are largely a matter of history accident and war.  Had the outcome of history been different, then current democratic decisions could very likely have also been different.

Current state boundaries are often disputed. Justifications purely based on the status quo offer no guidance for determining boundaries when the boundaries themselves are to be decided.

Geography

Physical and economic proximity tend to produce interdependencies, collective interests and shared values while remoteness tends to demarcate and insulate these connections, making geographical salience a plausible solution to the boundary problem.

Yet physical geography is just as likely to join rather insulate inter-agent connection depending on the issue being examined. 

Economic activity is largely influenced by political decisions making economic boundaries subsequent to political ones.

Many issues also transcend physical and economic boundaries.

Nationality 

National identity and cultural salience produce similar alignments as geography does yet nationality is often an effect rather than cause of existing political boundaries.

Cultural salience also fails to map adequately map to the concept of sovereignty.  Culture and nationality are characterised by fuzzy boundaries, pluralism and overlap.  The notion of national or cultural identity lack objective criteria for inclusion and their non-voluntary nature is inherently non-democratic making it a poor candidate to justify the legitimacy of democratic theory.

All Affected Principle 

Who is actually affected by any given decision is determined by the outcome of the eventual decision, meaning who is actually affected can’t be know until after the fact.

Who is likely to, or could be affected by any given decision is determined by what the particular issue for decision is.

Yet the determination by anyone potentially affected, of what issue is to be decided is viciously circular, as is determination by democratic means.

Invoking some further external justification for the determination of the issue to be decided simply results in a reductio ad infinitum and the creation of a boundary problem to the boundary problem.

The degree of likely affect will also determine the boundary of the demos.  A narrower interpretation of affect will result in a different boundary than a wider interpretation would, thus possibly altering the outcome of the actual decision.  

As with the determination of who can select the issue for decision, the issue of how much affect is sufficient to constitute an affected person can’t be resolved either internally or externally, unless we admit everyone and anyone who claims inclusion.

But enlarging the demo often conflicts with the Only Affected Principle.  Granting suffrage to someone not affected by an issue has just as much dilutive effect upon person sovereignty and autonomy as failure to grant suffrage to someone affected by a decision.

Admitting all agents to the demos then fails as an adequate solution to the boundary problem and we must readdress the issue of how much affect qualifies as affected.

Consent

As a method of voluntary association, consent offers a strong prima facie solution to the boundary problem.  Both inclusion within a group and the legitimacy of subsequent obligations can be justified if (and perhaps only if) they are acts of an agents free will.

Yet there difficulties justifying modern democracies with consent.  Few current individuals ever partook in the initial act of consent and the inability to suitably ‘opt-out’ of the demos undermines voluntarist claims.

States are also territorial and compulsory associations claim exclusive jurisdiction of their inhabitants.  Even if the democratic processes of a state are based on consent, their claims of exclusivity mean consent cannot adequately solve the boundary problem once formed.
